# Corporate Website - APM Enterprise Showcase

> **üöÄ This project demonstrates [APM CLI](https://github.com/github/apm-cli) capabilities** - A complete showcase of enterprise dependency composition, AI-native workflows, and automatic compliance enforcement.

**Enterprise-grade web development with automatic compliance and design enforcement** - Demonstrating APM dependency composition for consistent, compliant, and accessible development.

## What APM Dependencies Provide

üì¶ **Real enterprise packages working together**:

- **Compliance** - GDPR audit workflows, legal review processes, data protection (.prompt.md files)
- **Design Standards** - Accessibility enforcement, WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, design system rules (.instructions.md files)

## Real Enterprise Scenario

üè¢ **"Corporate Website"** - Project combining [`github/compliance-rules`](https://github.com/github/compliance-rules) + [`github/design-guidelines`](https://github.com/github/design-guidelines) for automatic compliance + design enforcement

**Result**: Your AI agents automatically know your company's security standards, design guidelines, and compliance requirements **before** they start coding.

## Quick Start (2 minutes)

> [!NOTE] 
> **üìã Prerequisites**: Get tokens at [github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new)  
> - **Fine-grained token** with Models + Copilot CLI permissions (preferred)  
> - **Classic PAT** with `read:packages` for npm registry (required separately)

```bash
# 1. Clone and enter the project
git clone https://github.com/github/corporate-website
cd corporate-website

# 2. Set up tokens and runtime (if not already done)
export GITHUB_CLI_PAT=your_fine_grained_token_here
export GITHUB_NPM_PAT=your_classic_pat_here
apm runtime setup copilot

# 3. Install APM dependencies (compliance + design packages)
apm install

# 4. Generate AGENTS.md with enterprise context
apm compile

# 5. Run your first enterprise workflow
apm run start --param name="Developer"
```

**That's it!** Your project now has enterprise-grade AI workflows with automatic compliance and design enforcement.

### Example `apm.yml` - Enterprise Dependencies in Action

Here's how enterprise packages compose together (similar to `package.json` in npm):

```yaml
name: corporate-website
version: 1.0.0
description: Corporate website with compliance and design standards
author: Corporate Team

dependencies:
  apm:
    - github/compliance-rules    # GDPR, legal review, audit trails
    - github/design-guidelines   # WCAG 2.1 AA, design system
  mcp:
    - io.github.github/github-mcp-server

scripts:
  start: "copilot --log-level all --log-dir copilot.log -p hello-world.prompt.md"
  
  # Compliance workflows (automatically discovered from dependencies)
  audit: "copilot --log-level all -p compliance-audit.prompt.md"
  gdpr-check: "codex gdpr-assessment.prompt.md"
  legal-review: "copilot --log-level all -p legal-review.prompt.md"
  
  # Design workflows (automatically discovered from dependencies)
  accessibility: "copilot --log-level all -p accessibility-audit.prompt.md"
  design-review: "copilot --log-level all -p design-review.prompt.md"
  style-check: "codex style-guide-check.prompt.md"
```

## What You Just Built

- **Enterprise Workflows** - Compliance audits, accessibility checks, legal reviews (.prompt.md files)
- **Context Enforcement** - GDPR rules, design standards automatically applied to AI responses
- **Dependency Composition** - `apm_modules/` with proven enterprise packages from other projects  
- **Universal Compatibility** - Works with any coding agent supporting the [Agents.md standard](https://github.com/joggrdocs/agents.md) (GitHub Copilot, Codex, etc.)

## Key Enterprise Workflows

```bash
apm run audit              # Run GDPR compliance audit
apm run accessibility      # Check WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
apm run design-review      # Validate design system adherence
apm run legal-review       # Legal compliance verification
apm run gdpr-check         # Data handling assessment
```

## üß† Context Optimization Engine

**The Challenge**: AI agents need exactly the right context for their current task, but loading everything creates cognitive overload, while missing key information breaks workflows.

**APM's Innovation**: Mathematical algorithms that automatically figure out the best places to put your context (standards, rules, guidelines, policies) so AI agents get exactly what they need, when they need it, without information overload.

### How It Works (No Math Degree Required!)

Think of it like organizing a company handbook. You could put everything in one giant manual that everyone carries around, or you could smartly distribute relevant sections to different departments.

APM does this automatically for your project context:

```bash
# See what APM is planning to do
apm compile --verbose --dry-run
```

**Real example from this project** - APM found 9 different context files (standards, compliance rules, guidelines) and had to decide where to put each one:

```
üéØ Smart Distribution Results:
‚Ä¢ Design standards ‚Üí Root level (affects 6 different folder types)
‚Ä¢ GDPR compliance ‚Üí Root level (affects 10 different folder types) 
‚Ä¢ API development ‚Üí backend/api/ only (affects 1 specific folder)
‚Ä¢ Testing strategy ‚Üí tests/ only (affects 3 test-related folders)
‚Ä¢ React components ‚Üí Root level (affects 3 component folders)
```

### The Mathematical Magic (Simplified)

**The Core Problem**: Every instruction needs to be accessible to files that need it, but agents shouldn't be overwhelmed with irrelevant instructions.

**APM's Solution**: Uses "distribution scores" to decide placement:
- **0-30% distribution** ‚Üí Place locally (like `backend/**/*.py` ‚Üí goes in `backend/api/AGENTS.md`)
- **30-70% distribution** ‚Üí Smart multi-placement (verify coverage, fallback to root if needed)
- **70%+ distribution** ‚Üí Place at root (like `**/*.{py,js,ts,tsx}` ‚Üí goes in root `AGENTS.md`)

**Why This Matters**: 
- ‚úÖ **Coverage Guarantee**: Every file can access the instructions it needs
- ‚ö° **Efficiency**: Agents see mostly relevant context (49.6% efficiency in this project)
- üß† **Cognitive Load**: No more overwhelming agents with irrelevant standards

### Real Results: 5 Smart AGENTS.md Files

Instead of one massive file, APM created 5 targeted context files:

1. **Root `/AGENTS.md`** - Design standards, compliance rules, React patterns (broad patterns)
2. **`backend/api/AGENTS.md`** - FastAPI security, database patterns (backend-specific)  
3. **`tests/AGENTS.md`** - Testing strategy, pytest patterns (testing-specific)
4. **`docs/AGENTS.md`** - Documentation standards (docs-specific)
5. **`scripts/deployment/AGENTS.md`** - DevOps patterns (deployment-specific)

**The Result**: When an AI agent works on `backend/api/auth.py`, it automatically inherits:
- Root standards (design + compliance) ‚Üê Always relevant
- Backend-specific API patterns ‚Üê Highly relevant
- No testing or documentation noise ‚Üê Clean context

### Universal Agent Compatibility

‚úÖ Works with **any** coding agent that supports [AGENTS.md](https://agents.md): GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Claude, Codex, etc.

**Architectural Advantage**: APM bridges the gap between maintainable governance (modular `.instructions.md` source files) and universal compatibility (standard `AGENTS.md` output), with smart optimization ensuring agents get exactly the context they need.

## Why APM for Enterprise Development?

Replace inconsistent compliance with engineered enterprise standards:

**‚ùå Before APM**: 
- "Add authentication" ‚Üí unpredictable compliance violations across team
- Manual accessibility audits catch issues in production  
- Design system violations slip through code review

**‚úÖ With APM Dependencies**: 
- Shared context + structured workflows ‚Üí consistent, compliant outcomes
- AI agents know GDPR requirements **before** they start coding
- Accessibility and design standards enforced automatically

**The Power**: Your AI agents understand enterprise compliance, accessibility requirements, and design standards from day one.

## Technology Stack
