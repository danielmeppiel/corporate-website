# Build Corporate Website with APM Dependencies

Create a professional corporate website that automatically integrates compliance standards and design guidelines through APM dependency composition.

## Context

You are building a corporate website that must meet strict compliance requirements and accessibility standards. Instead of manually implementing these requirements, you'll leverage APM dependencies that provide proven, tested workflows and context.

## Objectives

1. **Compliance Integration**: Implement GDPR compliance, audit logging, and legal review processes
2. **Accessibility Standards**: Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with proper semantic HTML and keyboard navigation  
3. **Design System**: Follow consistent typography, spacing, and color standards
4. **Performance**: Optimize for fast loading and responsive design across devices

## Dependencies Available

The project includes these APM dependencies:
- `danielmeppiel/compliance-rules` - Legal compliance, GDPR, audit trails
- `danielmeppiel/design-guidelines` - Accessibility, design system, UI standards

## Requirements

### Compliance Requirements (from compliance-rules dependency)
- Implement audit trail logging for all user interactions
- Add GDPR-compliant data handling with retention policies
- Include proper form validation and input sanitization
- Ensure error messages don't leak sensitive information
- Add consent management preparation for data collection

### Accessibility Requirements (from design-guidelines dependency)  
- Maintain WCAG 2.1 AA color contrast ratios (minimum 4.5:1)
- Implement keyboard navigation with proper focus indicators
- Add ARIA labels and semantic HTML structure
- Ensure minimum 44px touch targets for interactive elements
- Include screen reader announcements for dynamic content

### Design System Requirements
- Use the defined color palette with semantic color tokens
- Follow the 8px spacing grid system consistently
- Implement responsive typography with minimum 16px base font size
- Apply consistent border radius and shadow definitions
- Create reusable component patterns

## Technical Implementation

### Form Handling
Create accessible forms with:
- Proper label associations and help text
- Real-time validation with clear error messages
- ARIA announcements for screen readers
- Compliance logging for form submissions

### Interactive Elements
Implement buttons and links with:
- Sufficient color contrast and focus indicators
- Proper hover and focus states
- Touch-friendly sizing for mobile devices
- Loading states and feedback for user actions

### Data Management
Handle user data with:
- Encrypted storage for sensitive information
- Automatic cleanup based on retention policies
- User interaction logging for audit compliance
- Privacy-first approach with data minimization

## Expected Outcomes

After completion, the website should:
- ✅ Pass all WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility audits
- ✅ Meet GDPR compliance requirements with proper data handling
- ✅ Follow consistent design system standards
- ✅ Provide excellent user experience across all devices
- ✅ Include comprehensive audit trails for compliance reporting

## Testing and Validation

Use the available APM workflows to validate:
```bash
apm run accessibility     # Check WCAG compliance
apm run gdpr-check       # Verify data handling compliance  
apm run design-review    # Validate design system adherence
apm run legal-review     # Ensure legal compliance standards
```

## Success Criteria

The project succeeds when:
1. All APM workflow validations pass without issues
2. The website loads quickly and responds smoothly across devices
3. Users can navigate entirely via keyboard with clear focus indicators
4. Form submissions are properly logged and validated
5. Design elements follow the established system consistently

Build a website that demonstrates the power of APM dependency composition - where compliance and design standards are automatically integrated rather than manually implemented.
